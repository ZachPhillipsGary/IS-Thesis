	\begin{abstract}
	This interdisciplinary independent study thesis is divided into five chapters. The first
	chapter "On Virtual Realism" will outline the author's unique formulation of virtual
	realism, the ontological thesis that experiences in virtual reality are non-illusory, and
	that virtual objects truly exist in an equivalent sense to physical objects. Next,
	"Idealism and Virtual Reality" will describe the metaphysical implications of the
	idealism of British empiricist George Berkeley and the Yogacaran school of Mahayana
	Buddhism with respect to a virtual realist project. Although Berkeley and the
	Yogacaran philosopher Vasubandhu differ in several respects, both authorâ€™s projects
	are ultimately sympathetic to the aims of virtual realism. However, the Yogacaran
	idealism ultimately proves to be the superior choice for the virtual realist. The next
	chapter "Virtual physicalism" will posit a physicalist reply to the idealism of
	Vasubandhu and argue for a physicalist account of reality and virtual reality using
	Occam's razor as inspired by Saul Kripke's argumentation in his article Mad pain and
	Martian pain. Having established the merits of physicalist account of reality over the
	idealist standpoint, the remainder of this section will focus on how the metaphysical
	commitments of physicalism impact a virtual realist worldview. The fourth chapter
	will describe the implementation of an immersive virtual environment using
	physicalist principles and discuss how awareness of the virtual nature of a virtual
	reality environment impacts an agent's experience of said environment. Of specific
	interest to this project is how ideas from physicalist metaphysics can aid virtual reality
	designers in crafting non-player character experiences which do not fall victim to the
	uncanny valley phenomenon (Masahiro Mori's hypothesis that very human-like but
	slightly imperfect digital entities elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion among some
	observers). The fifth chapter describes the methodology and results of a usability study
	which attempts to measure the effectiveness of these philosophical principles in
	helping designers remedy the uncanny valley phenomenon in their creations.
